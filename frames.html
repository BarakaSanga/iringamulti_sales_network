<h2 class="h2">We host Business Doors (Business Frames)</h2>
<p class="paragraphs">
Our responsibility is to ensure that our customers are served according 
to their expectations. So, for the home owner or owner of a business door/doors 
(a frame/frames) who is looking for a renter or renters of business doors (frames), 
all he has to do is come to our office and tell us his need to rent his door or doors 
of business, in parallel with letting us know the places where the door or doors of his 
business are located and how many shillings he rents.
</p> 

<p class="paragraphs">
After our client gives us information about his business door or doors, we will find 
a tenant or tenants who will arrange the door or business doors in his area. Once we 
find a tenant or tenants, our client will pay us an amount of money equal to one month's 
rent for the door or doors of his business.
</p>

<p class="paragraphs">
This payment will be made if the tenant/tenants of the relevant business door or 
doors are satisfied or will be satisfied with the door or doors, then we will deduct 
our payment and the remaining amount of money we hand over to the owner of the business 
door or doors.</p>
</li>

<li>
<h2 class="h2">1.We are looking for good houses to live in for those who need to rent</h2>
<p class="paragraphs">
An institution, a family or an individual, if you need a house to rent in the city or in the 
village, all you have to do is come to our office or call our office and tell us what kind of 
house you want, and in which areas. If you are out of the region or out of the country, we will 
explain our procedure and how to make the payment. We will cooperate with you at every step and 
we will also be sending you pictures of the relevant house through WhatsApp or email for you to 
choose.</p> 

<p class="paragraphs">
If you are satisfied, we will make the payment on the house, and then you will come directly
to enter the house. You will have no reason to come and reach the guest house, we will find
you a house whether you are out of the region or abroad, you will come to enter directly
into your house.</p> 
</li>

<li>
<h2 class="h2">We are building houses, We are looking Farms and Plots for all Tanzanians who live abroad.</h2>
<p class="paragraphs">
Since there are many Tanzanians who live outside Tanzania but plan to return to live in Tanzania in 
the future; as well as there are Tanzanians who work abroad, and they really want to invest in 
Tanzania so that when they return they don't start with one, but they fail because they don't 
have someone to supervise the construction; and sometimes they don't have faith in their own 
relatives and families, that if they give them the responsibility to start the 
projects they want, it won't go as they expect.</p> 

<p class="paragraphs">
That shouldn't bother you and you don't have to think too much. Contact <strong>IRINGA MULTISALES NETWORK</strong> 
so that we can give you a procedure that will enable you to invest in your country of Tanzania. 
Through us you will build a house to live in, a school, a hotel, you can also buy land in the 
area and town you need in Tanzania, whether in the village or in the city.
</p> 

<p class="paragraphs">
You can also give us a map of the house, school or college that carried your vision. We can also show you maps
of houses, schools or colleges that we have for you to choose; Once you find the one that is your choice, we
will enter into an agreement and start building for you based on the contract. Our payment will be ten percent
(10%) of the value of your project that we manage.
</p> 


<p class="paragraphs">
Likewise, you may be abroad and want to build or buy a house for your parents or other relatives, 
you can contact <strong>IRINGA MULTISALES NETWORK</strong> so that we can serve you.
</p>
</li>

<h2 class="h2">We Manage Projects and Collect Taxes</h2>
<p class="paragraphs">
There are many citizens who own houses for rent and also have business frames, 
they have invested in these regions of the southern highlands but they live in 
other regions such as Dar-es-salaam, Arusha, Mwanza, Dodoma etc. and others are 
abroad working there and others live there. Many of them have failed to manage 
their projects effectively and find themselves incurring losses, and while fully
realizing that their expectations of keeping their projects are not as they had 
expected when they started the projects. 
</p> 

<p class="paragraphs">
Now don't get in trouble, contact <strong>IRINGA MULTISALES NETWORK</strong> we will enter into a contract 
with you and we will agree on how you will be paying us to manage your projects. If it is 
house rent, we will collect it and put it in your bank account. If it's a business frame,
we'll collect the money for you every time of paying tax, and we'll deposit it into your bank 
account.
</p> 

<p class="paragraphs">
We will also be managing the sanitation and safety of your home or business premises. 
We have a lot of experience in that area because currently there are some Indians and 
Swahili living inside and outside of Tanzania whose projects we manage. You have no reason 
to argue with your relatives and friends because of failure to manage your projects properly, 
you are welcome and contact us, and we will manage your projects properly according to the contractual 
agreement.
</p> 
</li>

<li>
<h2 class="h2">The Width of the Area We Work</h2>
<p class="paragraphs">
<strong>IRINGA MULTISALES NETWORK</strong> we work in all regions of the southern highlands in Tanzania and 
especially those that are on the tourist numbers such as, "Iringa, Njombe, Mbeya, Ruvuma, 
Songwe, Rukwa and Katavi" . But the headquarters of our offices are in the municipality of 
Iringa Town. We have chosen the headquarters to be in Iringa town because the government 
has chosen Iringa region to be the center of tourism for all regions of the highlands 
in the South.
