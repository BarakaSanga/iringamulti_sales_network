<h2 class="h2">We find our customers the products they need</h2>
<p class="paragraphs">
If a customer needs to buy a product through IRINGA MULTISALES NETWORK, 
for example a farm, plot, residential house, business house, machine, tractor, 
touring car or business car, etc. all you have to do is come to our office and tell us 
what you need and we will tell you the price the tool you need, 
(we will tell you the price of a new tool or an old tool).
If it is a farm, we will ask you the type of farm you want 
(a clean farm that is already cultivated or a new farm that is bush). 
If you need a plot, we will ask you, do you need the plot in the middle
of town or on the edge of town?</p>

<p class="paragraphs">
Once you tell us what you need, we will tell you the price, if you are satisfied, 
we will tell you the payment for the work we will do for you (which is usually ten percent 
(10%) of the cost of the product you want to buy through Iringa Multisales Network). Once we agree, 
we will give you a bank account to pay for; and once you have paid, you will return to our office with
a copy of the bank transfer paper and leave to us, the original copy of the bank transfer paper 
that you will keep yourself. Then we will tell you when to come so that we can hand over your product to you, it could be after a week, 
two or a month depending on the type of product you need. We can also work for you by finding
your need according to the value of your money, and in our activities, at every step we must involve our client.

<h2 class="h2">We Sell Our Clients' Properties on Their Behalf</h2>
<p class="paragraphs">
In the community there are many people who need to sell houses, 
cars, fields, plots, machines etc. but they do not know where they will find customers.
Now our company is the savior for such people. If you have a product that you want 
to sell through our company, all you have to do is come to our office with documents
that give you legal ownership; we will review the documents and if we are satisfied
we will enter into a contract of agreement, after closing the contract of agreement,
you will leave us a copy of the deed of the house, plot, farm or car card.</p>

<p class="paragraphs">After that, the office will carry out the process of finding 
a customer to sell your product. Once we sell your product, we will deduct the 
payment according to the value we sold your product as we agreed in the contract 
(usually it is ten percent (10%) of the sales value of your product). We hand over 
the remaining amount to the owner.

<h2 class="h2">We Help Retirees and Employees Who Have Ended Their Contracts</h2>
<p class="paragraphs">
Workers who are finishing their contracts and seniors who are retiring who were not lucky
enough to build their own house are too many and the unfortunate ones tend to lack an 
advisor when they get a lift. You are surprised that they are building a house with all 
the money they have earned, as a result the money runs out and the house is not yet finished. 
At the end of the day, they end up dying of thoughts. This problem has become very big in 
society.
</p> 

<p class="paragraphs">We at <strong>IRINGA MULTISALES NETWORK</strong> are here to provide a service to help
such old men or old women and employees who have finished their contracts. We welcome you to our office, 
we will give you advice, we will find you a low-cost house that you will finish building with
a small amount of money or we will find you a low-cost house that you will move into and you
will have some money left over to push you on your journey to old age. Our payment is only 
ten percent (10%). No old man came to us and regretted it.</p>

to their expectations. So, for the home owner or owner of a business door/doors

of business, in parallel with letting us know the places where the door or doors of his 
business are located and how many shillings he rents.
</p> 

<p class="paragraphs">
After our client gives us information about his business door or doors, we will find 
a tenant or tenants who will arrange the door or business doors in his area. Once we 
find a tenant or tenants, our client will pay us an amount of money equal to one month's 
rent for the door or doors of his business.
</p>

<p class="paragraphs">
This payment will be made if the tenant/tenants of the relevant business door or 
doors are satisfied or will be satisfied with the door or doors, then we will deduct

door or doors.</p>

<h2 class="h2">We are building houses, We are looking Farms and Plots for all Tanzanians who live abroad.</h2>
<p class="paragraphs">
Since there are many Tanzanians who live outside Tanzania but plan to return to live in Tanzania in 
the future; as well as there are Tanzanians who work abroad, and they really want to invest in 
Tanzania so that when they return they don't start with one, but they fail because they don't 
have someone to supervise the construction; and sometimes they don't have faith in their own 
relatives and families, that if they give them the responsibility to start the 
projects they want, it won't go as they expect.</p> 

<p class="paragraphs">
That shouldn't bother you and you don't have to think too much. Contact <strong>IRINGA MULTISALES NETWORK</strong> 
so that we can give you a procedure that will enable you to invest in your country of Tanzania.

<h2 class="h2">We Manage Projects and Collect Taxes</h2>
<p class="paragraphs">
There are many citizens who own houses for rent and also have business frames, 
they have invested in these regions of the southern highlands but they live in 
other regions such as Dar-es-salaam, Arusha, Mwanza, Dodoma etc. and others are 
abroad working there and others live there. Many of them have failed to manage 
their projects effectively and find themselves incurring losses, and while fully
realizing that their expectations of keeping their projects are not as they had 
expected when they started the projects. 
</p> 

<p class="paragraphs">
Now don't get in trouble, contact <strong>IRINGA MULTISALES NETWORK</strong> we will enter into a contract 
with you and we will agree on how you will be paying us to manage your projects. If it is 
house rent, we will collect it and put it in your bank account. If it's a business frame,
we'll collect the money for you every time of paying tax, and we'll deposit it into your bank 
account.
</p> 

<p class="paragraphs">
We will also be managing the sanitation and safety of your home or business premises. 
We have a lot of experience in that area because currently there are some Indians and 
Swahili living inside and outside of Tanzania whose projects we manage. You have no reason 
to argue with your relatives and friends because of failure to manage your projects properly, 
you are welcome and contact us, and we will manage your projects properly according to the contractual 
agreement.

<h2 class="h2">The Width of the Area We Work</h2>

highlands in Tanzania and especially those that are in tourism numbers such as, 
"Iringa, Njombe, Mbeya, Ruvuma, Songwe, Rukwa and Katavi" But now we work in all regions 
of Tanzania main land and Zanzibar. Our headquarters are located in Iringa City. 
We have chosen the headquarters to be in Iringa town because the government has chosen Iringa
