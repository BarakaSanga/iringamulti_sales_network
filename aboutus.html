<h2 class="h2">Registration</h2>
<p class="paragraphs">
This company is officially registered by the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania in order to 
provide services in the community to the eater and hungry. We work on behalf of the customer and the buyer, 
we connect the one who is looking for the product and the one who sells the product. Our responsibility is to 
ensure that we fulfill the expectations of every customer who comes to our office to seek service, that is,
we ensure that he gets good results according to what he expected. So, for anyone who needs to sell or buy quickly; 
we welcome him to our office. Trust is the basis of our work.

<h2 class="h2"><strong>Iringa Multisales Network </strong>are not brokers</h2>
<p class="paragraphs">
But our job is to connect the hungry and the needy with food, that is, 
we are the middle man who connects the person who has the product with the person who needs the product. 
So the difference between us and brokers is here:
"If a broker is told to sell a house for twenty-two million shillings (22,000,000/=), 
he can sell even thirty million shillings (30,000,000/=) or more. 
But the worst thing is if he finds a customer who wants 
twenty-two million shillings and five hundred thousand (22,500,000/=), 
or with twenty-three million shillings (23,000,000/=), many brokers do not agree to sell;
they see that the profit is small for them and as a result the house continues to stay 
on the market for a long time because of waiting for a big profit; they forget that the 
owner of the house is struggling with money. That is why he has decided to sell at a 
low price of twenty-two million shillings 
(22,000,000/=) so that it comes out quickly and he can solve the problem he has".

<li>
<h2 class="h2"><strong>We adhere to the Agreement Between Us and Our Client</strong></h2>
<p class="paragraphs">
<strong>IRINGA MULTISALES NETWORK</strong> we work according to the contractual agreement we reached with our client. 
If a customer tells us to sell a car or a house for twenty-two million shillings (22,000,000/=), 
and we sell the same price, we do not reduce one hundred shilling (100/=) nor do we increase one hundred shilling (100/=). And if the client says find me a house worth twenty-two million shillings (22,000,000/=), we find him a house worth twenty-two million shillings (22,000,000/=); and this is the reason why our customers increase every day, as honesty and transparency for our customers is our priority.</p>
